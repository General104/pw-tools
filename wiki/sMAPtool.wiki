=Converter=
  * Select the client maps root directory (the folder where all the "a" folders are located)
  * Select the target directory (a "maps" folder will created in the target directory, all "a" folders are stored inside this "maps" folder)
  * Select the files which should recursively be converted
  * Click start to begin converting process, this may take some minutes depending on selected files

_*Note:*_ `*`.t2bk will only export terrain, disregarding litmodels


=path.sev Editor=
  * Open path file
  * Select a background template if you want
  * Select a path from the list, the path is shown in the image
  * Use context menu to add/remove path from the list
  * Select a point of the selected path to edit
  * Use context menu to add/remove point from the list
  * Select a segment of the selected path to edit
  * Use context menu to add/remove segment from the list
  * Keep in mind a segment needs always start and endpoint so you have always one segment less than points
  * The segment length will be calculated automatically when changing startpoint/endpoint, or their coordinates
  * Automatic length calculation is based on line mode, not curve mode { segment control point meaning is unknown to me (B-Splines, Polynomial, ... ?) }
  * When finished click save to store changes to the loaded path file
