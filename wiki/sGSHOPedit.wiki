=sGSHOPedit - simple GSHOP editor=

An editor for gshop.data file of the popular MMORPG Perfect World.


=Quick Start Tutorial=
_sGSHOPedit uses it's own database file which contains all informations (client and server files complement each other, so they are a inconsistent base for editing...)_

==Create a new Database==
  # start sGSHOPedit
  # import an existing gshop.data (1.4.4 client preferred)
  # save the file to gshop.db or a name of your choice


*Load & Edit a Database*
  # start sGSHOPedit
  # load your database file (i.e. gshop.db)
  # edit the categories and entries like in the old version


*Export a Database*
  # start sGSHOPedit
  # load your database file (i.e. gshop.db)
  # export one client 1.4.4 file
  # export one server 1.4.4 file
  # put the client file into your client and the server file on your server
